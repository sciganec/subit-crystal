# Crystal Model

The crystal is the fractal structure generated by the SUBIT operator.  
It is the minimal geometric form in which SUBIT’s invariants, states, and transitions become visible.  
Every layer of the crystal is a projection of the same underlying operator.

## Structure

### 6‑Bit Space  
The crystal occupies a 6‑dimensional binary space {0,1}^6.  
Each point in this space is a unique archetype.

### Polarity Axes  
Each of the six bits represents a Yin/Yang polarity.  
The crystal is the full combinatorial expansion of these six tensions.

### Trigram Lattice  
The crystal reduces into eight trigram nodes.  
These nodes form the fundamental symmetry group of the structure.

### Bigram Cube  
Three bigram axes define the crystal’s geometry:  
subject, vector, and phase.  
Each axis contains four states.

### 64‑State Matrix  
The crystal unfolds into a complete 8×8 matrix of archetypes.  
This matrix is the visible surface of the operator.

## Dynamics

### Expansion and Contraction  
The crystal cycles from maximal activation (111) to maximal potential (000).  
All transitions follow the same invariant order.

### Fractal Self‑Similarity  
MICRO, MACRO, and META levels reproduce the same geometry.  
Zooming does not change the structure.

### Spectral Phases  
Each trigram corresponds to a color phase:  
Blue, Green, Lime, Yellow, Orange, Red, Burgundy, Purple.  
These phases represent energetic states of the crystal.

## Interpretation

### WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
The crystal encodes subject, spatial orientation, and temporal phase.  
These axes remain orthogonal at all scales.

### Subject–Object Mediation  
The crystal is the medium through which structure passes:  
Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

### Archetypal Resolution  
Every raw state resolves into one of 64 archetypes.  
Each archetype is a stable point in the crystal.

## Consequence

The crystal is not a model of structure.  
It is the geometric manifestation of the operator that generates all structure.  
Every form, state, and interpretation emerges as a projection of the crystal.
