# Crystal Cycle

The crystal cycle is the ordered progression through the eight trigram states.  
It represents the full expansion and contraction of structural clarity, moving from maximal activation to maximal potential and returning to origin without loss.

---

## Sequence

The cycle follows the invariant trigram order:

100 → 101 → 110 → 111 → 011 → 010 → 001 → 000

Each transition preserves structural continuity and maintains the geometry of the crystal.

## Phases

### Activation  
100 Blue  
101 Green  
110 Lime  
111 Yellow  

These states represent increasing structural presence and maximal clarity.

### Dissolution  
011 Orange  
010 Red  
001 Burgundy  
000 Purple  

These states represent the return from clarity into potential.

## Dynamics

### Expansion  
Movement from 100 to 111 increases activation, orientation, and structural definition.

### Peak  
111 is the point of maximal clarity and full structural expression.

### Contraction  
Movement from 111 to 000 reduces activation and returns the system to pure potential.

### Closure  
000 completes the cycle and prepares the next iteration.

## Invariance

The cycle is identical across MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.  
No transformation can alter the order, polarity, or symmetry of the sequence.

---

## Consequence

The crystal cycle defines the temporal logic of SUBIT‑crystal.  
Every archetype, transition, and interpretation emerges as a phase within this invariant loop.
