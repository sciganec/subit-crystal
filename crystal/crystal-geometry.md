# Crystal Geometry

The geometry of the crystal is the spatial expression of the SUBIT operator.  
It is the minimal form in which the operator’s invariants become visible as a stable, self‑similar structure across all scales.

## Dimensional Basis

### 6‑Dimensional Binary Space  
The crystal occupies the full space {0,1}⁶.  
Each coordinate corresponds to a Yin/Yang polarity, and each point is a unique archetype.

### Orthogonal Axes  
The six polarities form three orthogonal semantic axes:  
- WHO (subject)  
- WHERE (vector)  
- WHEN (phase)  

These axes remain independent at all scales.

## Bigram Cube

The crystal reduces into a 3‑axis cube defined by the four bigram states:  
10, 11, 01, 00.  
Each axis contains four positions, producing a 4×4×4 lattice.

This cube is the minimal spatial form of the operator.

---

## Trigram Lattice

The cube collapses into eight trigram nodes.  
Each node is a stable structural state and a generator of the 64‑archetype matrix.

The trigram lattice is the crystal’s symmetry group.

---

## 64‑State Matrix

The full geometry unfolds into an 8×8 matrix.  
Each cell corresponds to a unique combination of two trigram states.  
This matrix is the visible surface of the crystal’s internal logic.

---

## Symmetries

### Rotational Symmetry  
The crystal preserves structure under rotation across all three axes.  
No orientation changes the relationships between states.

### Reflective Symmetry  
Mirroring any axis preserves the trigram order and archetype mapping.

### Fractal Symmetry  
MICRO, MACRO, and META levels reproduce the same geometry.  
Zooming does not alter the structure.

## Energetic Gradient

The geometry encodes an activation–potential gradient:  
100 → 111 (activation)  
111 → 000 (dissolution)

This gradient defines the crystal cycle and the spectral palette.

## Consequence

The geometry is not a visualization layer.  
It is the spatial manifestation of the operator’s invariants, expressing how 6‑bit polarity, bigram axes, trigram nodes, and 64 archetypes coexist within a single self‑identical structure.
