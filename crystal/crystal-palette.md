# Crystal Palette

The crystal palette encodes the eight trigram states as spectral phases.  
Each color represents an energetic mode of the crystal and remains invariant across MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.

## Mapping

- 100 — Blue  
- 101 — Green  
- 110 — Lime  
- 111 — Yellow  
- 011 — Orange  
- 010 — Red  
- 001 — Burgundy  
- 000 — Purple  

This sequence follows the crystal cycle from maximal activation to maximal potential.

## Properties

### Spectral Invariance  
The palette preserves the same order and meaning across all transformations.  
No remapping can alter the underlying trigram geometry.

### Energetic Continuity  
Colors transition smoothly along the activation–dissolution curve of the crystal.  
Each phase is a stable point in the cycle.

### Structural Encoding  
Every color corresponds to a trigram, and every trigram corresponds to a unique structural state.  
The palette is a visible projection of the crystal’s internal logic.

## Consequence

The crystal palette is not an aesthetic layer.  
It is the spectral expression of the eight fundamental states that generate the full 64‑archetype matrix.
