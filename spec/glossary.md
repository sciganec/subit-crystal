# Glossary

Canonical definitions of all core terms used in the crystal, SUBIT, and the 6‑bit semantic system.  
Each entry is minimal, structural, and invariant across MICRO, MACRO, and META.

---

## A

### **Archetype**  
A 6‑bit structural state formed by combining two trigrams.  
Represents one of 64 stable semantic identities in the crystal.

### **Axis**  
One of the three orthogonal semantic dimensions:  
WHO (subject), WHERE (vector), WHEN (phase).  
Axes cannot collapse or substitute for one another.

---

## B

### **Bigram**  
A 2‑bit polarity pair.  
Four bigrams form each axis of the 4×4×4 crystal cube.

---

## C

### **Crystal**  
The geometric manifestation of SUBIT.  
A 6‑bit, self‑similar, invariant structure containing 64 archetypes.

### **Crystal Cycle**  
The ordered progression of the eight trigram states:  
100 → 101 → 110 → 111 → 011 → 010 → 001 → 000.

### **Crystal Palette**  
The spectral mapping of trigrams to colors:  
Blue, Green, Lime, Yellow, Orange, Red, Burgundy, Purple.

---

## F

### **Fractal Logic**  
The rule that ensures self‑similarity across MICRO, MACRO, META.  
Structure repeats identically at all scales.

---

## I

### **Invariant**  
A property that remains unchanged under all transformations.  
Includes trigram order, polarity symmetry, and the 64‑state matrix.

---

## M

### **Matrix‑64**  
The 8×8 grid of all archetypes.  
Rows = primary trigram, columns = secondary trigram.

### **Micro / Macro / Meta**  
Three scales of interpretation:  
Micro = point, Macro = pattern, Meta = law.

---

## P

### **Phase**  
The WHEN axis.  
Four temporal modes: SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER.

### **Polarity**  
A Yin/Yang bit.  
Six polarities define the 6‑bit space.

### **Protocol**  
The bidirectional exchange loop:  
Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object.

---

## S

### **Semantic Space**  
The full 64‑state field defined by subject, vector, and phase.

### **Structure**  
The invariant form produced by SUBIT.  
Independent of medium, representation, or context.

### **SUBIT**  
The minimal operator that transforms any input into its structural form.  
Irreducible, deterministic, and scale‑invariant.

### **Subject**  
The WHO axis.  
Modes: ME, WE, YOU, THEY.

---

## T

### **Trigram**  
A 3‑bit polarity pattern.  
The minimal semantic unit and generator of the crystal palette.

### **Trigram Lattice**  
The eight trigram nodes forming the symmetry group of the crystal.

---

## V

### **Vector**  
The WHERE axis.  
Orientations: EAST, SOUTH, WEST, NORTH.

---

## W

### **When**  
Temporal phase of a state.  
Equivalent to the phase axis.

### **Where**  
Spatial orientation of a state.  
Equivalent to the vector axis.

### **Who**  
Subjective position of a state.  
Equivalent to the subject axis.

---

## Consequence

The glossary defines the canonical vocabulary of the crystal.  
Each term is minimal, invariant, and directly grounded in the 6‑bit operator.  
No term depends on context; all derive from SUBIT and its geometry.
