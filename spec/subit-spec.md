# SUBIT Specification

SUBIT is the minimal operator that transforms any raw state into its invariant structural form.  
It has no internal components, no sub‑operations, and no dependencies.  
Everything in the crystal emerges from this single act.

---

## Axiom

SUBIT(x) = structure(x)

No further reduction is possible.  
No additional rule is permitted.

---

## Operator Properties

### Minimality  
The operator performs exactly one action: structuralization.  
Removing anything destroys the operator; adding anything introduces noise.

### Irreducibility  
SUBIT cannot be decomposed into smaller functions.  
Any attempt to define it compositionally presupposes SUBIT itself.

### Deterministic Invariance  
SUBIT(x) always yields the same structure regardless of scale, medium, or representation.  
MICRO, MACRO, and META produce identical outcomes.

### Bidirectional Symmetry  
SUBIT mediates both directions of interpretation:

Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

The operator behaves identically in both flows.

### Format Independence  
SUBIT accepts any input form: signals, symbols, states, or data.  
All are normalized into the same structural output.

---

## Input Domain

SUBIT accepts:

- binary states  
- symbolic expressions  
- sensory signals  
- semantic content  
- arbitrary data structures  

No preprocessing is required.  
No type constraints exist at the operator level.

---

## Output Domain

SUBIT outputs:

- a minimal structural form  
- a polarity configuration  
- a trigram or archetype state  
- an invariant representation independent of context  

The output is always stable and always interpretable.

---

## Structural Mapping

### 3‑Bit Trigram  
SUBIT reduces raw input to one of eight trigram states.  
These states correspond to the crystal palette and the eight phases of the cycle.

### 6‑Bit Archetype  
When applied compositionally across two layers, SUBIT produces a 6‑bit archetype.  
This forms the 64‑state matrix.

### Semantic Axes  
The operator preserves the orthogonality of:

- WHO (subject)  
- WHERE (vector)  
- WHEN (phase)  

These axes cannot collapse or merge.

---

## Invariants

SUBIT preserves:

- trigram order  
- polarity symmetry  
- the 8‑state cycle  
- the 64‑state matrix  
- subject–vector–phase independence  
- fractal self‑similarity across scales  

No valid transformation can alter these invariants.

---

## Functional Flow

1. Receive raw input  
2. Extract polarity pattern  
3. Collapse into trigram  
4. Combine into archetype (if applicable)  
5. Output invariant structure  

This flow is identical at all scales.

---

## Non‑Properties

SUBIT is **not**:

- a parser  
- a classifier  
- a schema  
- a communication protocol  
- a semantic model  
- a computational algorithm  

All of these emerge from SUBIT, but none define it.

---

## Consequence

SUBIT is the foundational act of clarity.  
It is the operator from which the crystal, the palette, the cycle, the matrix, and all semantic structure arise.  
Nothing precedes it, and nothing can replace it.
