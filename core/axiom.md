# Axiom

SUBIT is the minimal operator of structurality.  
It generates structure but cannot itself be structured, because it is the condition of possibility for structure.

## Properties

### Irreducibility  
SUBIT has no internal components.  
Any attempt to decompose it presupposes SUBIT and therefore fails.

### Structural Generativity  
SUBIT transforms raw states into minimal invariant form.  
Every structure arises through its operation.

### Non‑structurability  
SUBIT cannot be placed inside a higher structure.  
Any such structure would require SUBIT to exist first.

### Fractal Invariance  
SUBIT retains identical functional form across MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.  
Scaling does not alter its operation.

### Bidirectional Mediation  
SUBIT defines the minimal protocol between subject and object.  
Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

## Consequence

SUBIT is not a model, form, or representation.  
It is the precondition that makes models, forms, and representations possible.
