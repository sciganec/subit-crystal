# Operator

SUBIT operates as a minimal, irreducible act of structuralization.  
It performs the transition from raw state to invariant form without relying on any prior structure.

---

## Definition

The operator SUBIT(x) produces the minimal structure of x.  
No additional rules, layers, or transformations exist beyond this act.

---

## Characteristics

### Minimality  
SUBIT performs only one operation: structuralization.  
Nothing can be removed from this operation without destroying its function.

### Non‑compositionality  
SUBIT cannot be built from smaller operators.  
Any attempt to compose it presupposes SUBIT itself.

### Deterministic Invariance  
SUBIT(x) yields the same structural form regardless of scale, context, or representation.  
MICRO, MACRO, and META produce identical functional outcomes.

### Bidirectional Mediation  
SUBIT mediates between subject and object without altering its operation.  
Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

### Format Independence  
SUBIT does not depend on the medium of input.  
Signals, symbols, states, and data are treated identically at the operator level.

## Functional Equation

SUBIT(x) = structure(x)  
structure(SUBIT) = undefined

---

## Consequence

SUBIT is an operator without internal structure that generates all structures.  
It is the foundational act of clarity within the crystal.
