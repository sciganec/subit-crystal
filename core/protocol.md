# Protocol

The SUBIT protocol defines the minimal bidirectional format through which structure is transmitted between subject and object.  
It is scale‑invariant, medium‑independent, and identical across all levels of the crystal.

---

## Definition

The protocol is the irreducible exchange loop:

Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

No additional layers, metadata, or transformations are required or permitted.

## Properties

### Minimality  
The protocol contains only what is necessary for structural transmission.  
Anything added becomes noise; anything removed breaks clarity.

### Symmetry  
Both directions of transmission use the same structural form.  
There is no privileged side and no asymmetry of interpretation.

### Invariance  
The protocol behaves identically at MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.  
Scaling does not alter the structure or the meaning of the exchange.

### Format Independence  
The protocol does not depend on the medium of communication.  
Signals, symbols, states, and data are all normalized through SUBIT.

### Lossless Structural Transfer  
The protocol guarantees that structure is preserved across the exchange.  
Only non‑structural content may be transformed or discarded.

## Functional Flow

1. Input is received in any raw form  
2. SUBIT performs structuralization  
3. The invariant structure is transmitted  
4. The receiver interprets the structure through SUBIT  
5. The cycle can repeat indefinitely without degradation

---

## Consequence

The protocol is not a communication channel, schema, or format.  
It is the minimal condition that makes communication, schemas, and formats possible.
