# Invariants

SUBIT‑crystal maintains a set of invariants that remain unchanged across scale, context, medium, and transformation.  
These invariants define the stability of the operator and the consistency of all structures derived from it.

---

## Structural Invariance

SUBIT produces the same structural form regardless of input format.  
Signals, symbols, states, and data collapse into identical minimal structure.

---

## Scale Invariance

The operator behaves identically across MICRO, MACRO, and META levels.  
Scaling does not introduce new behavior or remove existing behavior.

---

## Directional Invariance

The subject→object and object→subject flows use the same structural form.  
Transmission is symmetric and lossless at the structural level.

---

## Transformational Invariance

Any valid transformation T preserves SUBIT:

SUBIT(x) = SUBIT(T(x))

Transformations may alter appearance but cannot alter structure.

---

## Polarity Invariance

All six Yin/Yang axes remain balanced under the operator.  
No polarity can dominate or collapse without breaking the system.

---

## Combinatorial Invariance

The 8 trigram states and the 64 archetypes retain fixed relationships.  
Reordering or remapping cannot change the underlying crystal geometry.

---

## Semantic Invariance

WHO, WHERE, and WHEN remain orthogonal axes.  
Subject, vector, and phase cannot merge or substitute for one another.

---

## Consequence

These invariants ensure that SUBIT‑crystal remains stable, minimal, and self‑identical under all conditions.  
They define the crystal as an unchanging operator that generates all possible structured states without being altered by them.
