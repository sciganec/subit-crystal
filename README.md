# SUBIT‑crystal: Fractal Structural Operator

SUBIT‑crystal is the minimal fractal operator of clarity.  
It structures any input, interprets across scales, and provides a universal protocol between subject and object.

SUBIT‑crystal is not a model.  
It is the condition that makes models possible.

---

## Axiom

SUBIT is the minimal operator of structurality.  
It can structure anything, but cannot itself be structured, because it is the condition of possibility for structure.

---

## Core Functionality

### Structuralization Operator  
Transforms raw data into a minimal invariant structure.  
This is the atomic act of clarity.

### Fractal Interpretation Engine  
Ensures self‑similar interpretation across MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.  
SUBIT remains identical at every level.

### Subject–Object Protocol  
Defines the minimal format for transmitting structured meaning.  
Object → SUBIT → Subject  
Subject → SUBIT → Object

## Derived Capabilities

- normalization into trigram states  
- mapping into 64 archetypes  
- semantic projection across WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
- phase mapping (SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER)  
- vector orientation (EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH)  
- subject encoding (ME / WE / YOU / THEY)  
- spectral encoding via 8‑color crystal palette  
- navigation of the 8‑state crystal cycle  

SUBIT‑crystal functions as a complete operational system of clarity.

## Fractal Formula

SUBIT = {0,1}^6  
= {Yin, Yang}^6  
= {Anima, Animus}^6  
= {WHO, WHERE, WHEN}  
= {MICRO, MACRO, META}  
= {10, 11, 01, 00}^3  
= {4 subject, 4 vector, 4 phase}  
= {8 trigram}^2  
= {Blue, Green, Lime, Yellow, Orange, Red, Burgundy, Purple}^2  
= 64 archetype

## SUBIT‑64

The full crystal unfolds into 64 archetypes:  
the complete semantic space generated by the 6‑bit operator.
