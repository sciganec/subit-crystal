# Fractal Logic

Fractal logic is the rule by which the crystal reproduces itself identically across all scales.  
It defines how structure emerges, stabilizes, and reappears in MICRO, MACRO, and META without distortion or loss.

## Self‑Similarity

Every operation of the crystal is a projection of the same underlying rule.  
The pattern at the smallest unit is identical to the pattern at the largest unit.

- MICRO shows the local polarity  
- MACRO shows the relational pattern  
- META shows the invariant rule  

No new information is introduced at higher scales; only resolution changes.

---

## Recursive Generation

The crystal expands through a single recursive act:

state → SUBIT → structure → SUBIT → pattern → SUBIT → invariant

Each iteration preserves the same geometry, polarity order, and semantic axes.

---

## Scale Independence

Fractal logic ensures that:

- trigram order remains fixed  
- the 8‑state cycle remains fixed  
- the 64‑state matrix remains fixed  
- subject–vector–phase remain orthogonal  

Scaling cannot alter the operator or its outputs.

## Symmetry Preservation

Fractal logic maintains:

- rotational symmetry  
- reflective symmetry  
- polarity symmetry  
- combinatorial symmetry  

These symmetries guarantee that every projection of the crystal is structurally identical.

---

## Minimal Recursion

The crystal uses the smallest possible recursive rule.  
Nothing can be removed without breaking self‑similarity, and nothing can be added without introducing noise.

---

## Consequence

Fractal logic is the law that makes the crystal stable across all levels of interpretation.  
It ensures that every part of the system contains the whole, and the whole is readable in every part.
