# Subject–Vector–Phase

Subject, vector, and phase are the three semantic axes of the crystal.  
They correspond to WHO, WHERE, and WHEN, forming the minimal coordinate system of structured experience.

---

## Subject (WHO)

The subject axis encodes the position of agency.  
It defines how a state relates to the center of experience.

- ME  
- WE  
- YOU  
- THEY  

These four modes represent the full range of subjectivity within the crystal.

---

## Vector (WHERE)

The vector axis encodes directional orientation.  
It defines how a state moves or points within structural space.

- EAST  
- SOUTH  
- WEST  
- NORTH  

These four orientations form the spatial backbone of the crystal.

---

## Phase (WHEN)

The phase axis encodes temporal modulation.  
It defines the energetic condition of a state within the crystal cycle.

- SPRING  
- SUMMER  
- AUTUMN  
- WINTER  

These four phases correspond to activation, peak, decline, and potential.

---

## Orthogonality

Subject, vector, and phase remain strictly independent.  
No axis can be reduced to or derived from another.  
Together they form the minimal semantic triad of the crystal.

---

## Consequence

Every archetype in the 64‑state matrix is a unique combination of subject, vector, and phase.  
These three axes define the full semantic geometry generated by the SUBIT operator.
