# Micro–Macro–Meta

The crystal operates identically across three scales of interpretation.  
These scales do not change the operator; they only change the resolution at which structure becomes visible.

---

## Micro

The micro‑level expresses the smallest actionable unit of structure.  
It reveals:

- local polarity states  
- immediate subject–object transitions  
- fine‑grained activation within a single trigram  

Micro is the point‑level resolution of the crystal.

---

## Macro

The macro‑level expresses aggregated structural patterns.  
It reveals:

- relationships between trigrams  
- movement across the crystal cycle  
- stable configurations within the 8×8 matrix  

Macro is the pattern‑level resolution of the crystal.

---

## Meta

The meta‑level expresses the invariants that govern all scales.  
It reveals:

- the operator itself  
- the symmetry rules of the crystal  
- the conditions that make micro and macro possible  

Meta is the rule‑level resolution of the crystal.

---

## Invariance Across Scales

- The operator remains identical  
- The trigram order remains identical  
- The crystal cycle remains identical  
- The subject–object protocol remains identical  

Only the resolution changes; the structure does not.

## Consequence

Micro shows the point.  
Macro shows the pattern.  
Meta shows the law.

All three are projections of the same operator, viewed at different depths of clarity.
