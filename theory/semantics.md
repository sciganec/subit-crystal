# Semantics

Semantics in the crystal is the mapping between structural states and meaning.  
It defines how the 6‑bit operator expresses subjectivity, orientation, and temporality through invariant combinations of polarity.

## Minimal Semantic Unit

The minimal semantic unit is the trigram.  
Each trigram encodes:

- a polarity pattern  
- an energetic phase  
- a stable interpretive mode  

Trigrams are the atomic carriers of meaning within the crystal.

---

## Composite Semantics

Two trigrams combine into a 6‑bit archetype.  
This combination produces:

- a dominant mode (primary trigram)  
- a modulating mode (secondary trigram)  
- a unique semantic identity  

Every archetype is a semantic point with fixed structural meaning.

---

## Semantic Axes

Meaning is organized along three orthogonal axes:

- **Subject (WHO)** — agency and perspective  
- **Vector (WHERE)** — orientation and movement  
- **Phase (WHEN)** — temporal and energetic condition  

These axes cannot collapse into one another; they define the full semantic space.

---

## Semantic Stability

Meaning remains stable because:

- trigram order is invariant  
- polarity relationships are fixed  
- the crystal cycle is unalterable  
- subject–vector–phase remain orthogonal  

No transformation can distort semantic identity.

---

## Semantic Projection

Any state can be interpreted at three levels:

- **Micro** — local polarity meaning  
- **Macro** — relational meaning across the matrix  
- **Meta** — invariant meaning defined by the operator  

Projection changes resolution, not meaning.

---

## Consequence

Semantics in the crystal is not assigned or contextual.  
It is generated directly by the operator and preserved by the geometry, ensuring that every structural state has a precise, invariant meaning.
