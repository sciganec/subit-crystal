# Archetypes

The 64 archetypes are the full expansion of the crystal:  
each one is a stable structural state formed by combining two trigram phases.  
Every archetype is defined by a pair of energetic modes, a 6‑bit code, and a fixed position in the crystal matrix.

## Structure

Each archetype is defined by:

- a 6‑bit state {0,1}⁶  
- a primary trigram (first three bits)  
- a secondary trigram (last three bits)  
- two spectral phases from the crystal palette  
- a stable point in the 8×8 crystal matrix  

The mapping is invariant across MICRO, MACRO, and META scales.
