# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the SUBIT‑64 canon and its documentation.  
Each entry reflects structural additions only; no stylistic or non‑invariant changes are recorded.

---

## 1.0.0 — Initial Canon Release

### Added
- Full SUBIT‑64 specification, including operator axiom and invariants  
- Crystal palette (8 trigram colors)  
- Trigram map and color map (JSON)  
- Matrix‑64 (8×8 archetype grid)  
- Archetypes list (64 canonical states)  
- Subject–Vector–Phase semantic axes  
- Micro / Macro / Meta scale definitions  
- Fractal logic specification  
- Semantic model (semantics.md)  
- Minimal implementation (pseudocode + required tables)  
- Data format specification (JSON, CSV, Markdown constraints)  
- API specification (structural endpoints only)  
- Crystal visualization guidelines  
- SUBIT‑64 examples (raw, symbolic, sensory, textual, matrix‑based)  
- Glossary of canonical terms  

### Established
- Invariant trigram order  
- 6‑bit structural identity  
- Orthogonality of WHO / WHERE / WHEN  
- Deterministic SUBIT operator behavior  
- Forbidden transformations and invalid formats  

---

## 1.0.1 — Structural Documentation Pass

### Updated
- Clarified invariants in data‑format.md  
- Strengthened minimality constraints in minimal‑implementation.md  
- Expanded glossary definitions for precision  
- Improved matrix‑64.md formatting for readability  

### Added
- Explicit row/column indexing rules in archetype definitions  
- Consequence sections across all documents for canonical closure  

---

## 1.1.0 — Crystal Externalization Layer

### Added
- crystal-visualization.md with 3D cube, lattice, and palette rules  
- Expanded semantic axes explanation in subject-vector-phase.md  
- Visualization constraints (forbidden encodings, scale invariance)  

### Updated
- API.md to include `/axes` and `/cycle` endpoints  
- semantics.md with projection rules across scales  

---

## 1.2.0 — Canonical JSON Suite

### Added
- trigram-map.json  
- color-map.json  

### Updated
- data-format.md to reference JSON suite explicitly  
- matrix‑64.md to align with JSON matrix representation  

---

## 1.3.0 — Example Expansion

### Added
- subit64-examples.md with seven fully worked examples  
- Sensory and symbolic input demonstrations  
- Matrix lookup and reverse‑lookup examples  

### Updated
- semantics.md with clearer composite semantics section  

---

## 1.3.1 — Consistency Pass

### Updated
- Unified terminology across all files (primary/secondary, row/col, palette names)  
- Ensured all binary codes appear in canonical order  
- Removed non‑structural phrasing from several documents  

---

## Consequence

The changelog tracks only structural evolution of the canon.  
Every entry reflects refinement toward minimality, invariance, and executable clarity.  
No non‑structural changes are recorded.
